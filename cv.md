## About me
My name is Evgeny, I am 20 years old and I am a freelancer. My specialty is design. In my works I use the editors Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator. I am own HTML and CSS code. For create websites, I use Tilda, Wordpress and Readymag platforms. I can say about myself that I do my work punctually, pay attention to details, and am able to competently plan the time to complete the task. I like to find something new for myself in every job.

Remote work allows me to devote more time to my development, I spend my free time learning the basics of Frontend development. I am interested in developing web applications and websites. Development in this area is a promising direction, and there is also a large library of free sources that will help me develop in this area.
